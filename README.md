# This is our third Project at GA code school - Surveys Says! - Team Project

The team members:
-   `Mayoor Patil`
-   `Anne Belakonis`
-   `Mark Keeler`
-   `Michaele Dunn`

-   This is `Survey Says!` application that allows signed-in users to create surveys and all other users including signed-in to respond to surveys
-   Its a responsive single page application primarly built using JavaScript and Express
-   This is our third project in javascript and first using Express

In the future plan is to include support for the following:

-   Allow creators of the survey to add different types of answer options.
-   Have an image uploaded and displayed for each survey created

We are open to feedback and suggestions. If you have any please connect with us and share

1.  Any user who visits our `Survey Says!` website can respond to surveys seen on the home page
2.  If users wish to keep track of their surveys and responses, a user needs to sign-in
3.  If you are a not registered user, you can register yourself by using the "Sign In / Register" button
4.  Once signed in users have the option to change password or signout
5.  Once users sign-in he/she can create surveys, view dashboard and respond to other surveys
6.  Signed-in users also have the ability to view, update and delete a survey

2.  GIT for code repository and version control
3.  ATOM javascript editor
4.  MongoDB - Backend database
5.  Mongoose - MongoDB object modeling tool

## Development Process

Here is how we approached the development of this application

1.  Had the requirements broken down into user stories and also had a basic wireframe created
2.  Based on that we spent some time designing the flow of the application and share responsibilities
3.  Then we used pari programming techniques and built basic html file so that we could start coding the backend APIs.
4.  We also paired programmed continiously switching roles on other aspects of the project, such as integrating the ajax service calls and displaying the response received from the API back to the users. This helped to in building the application faster since the observer was able to identify any anomolies of the coder
4.  With every little change we made we unit tested as a team all along to minimize defects and fixes. This helped a lot as we were able to identify minor defects and fix along the way.
5.  All along we also ensured every feature was committed and pushed to the GIT repository. This was specifically helpful since we knew exactly what had changed with each feature and did not have to struggle and go through a ton of code to fix or implement any missing functionality
